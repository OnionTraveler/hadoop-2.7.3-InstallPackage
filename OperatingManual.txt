All ssh setting should be completed before you source settingup.sh
*Including: (# ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -P "")
	master -> master   「# cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys」
	master -> slaver1  「# ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@ipslaver1」
	master -> slaver2  「# ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@ipslaver2」

	slaver1 -> slaver1 「# cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys」
	slaver1 -> master  「# ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@ipmaster」
	slaver1 -> slaver2 「# ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@ipslaver2」

*You MUST test whether ssh connection succeed or not! 「# ssh master」「# ssh ipslaver1」「# ssh ipslaver2」
*Of course, 「# service ssh start」 before testing!

*Also, you SHOULD change their IP in the settingup.sh, too! (You can use 「source ipchange.sh」 to modify all ip in settingup.sh; HOWEVER, Remember to double check what it writes in ipchange.sh when you use it!!!))

*REMEMBER move the directory hadoop-2.7.3-InstallPackage to /tmp before settingup.sh, or it will be something wrong during setting up!


<<PS>>
**You should「source change2apt.sh」to automatically revise settingup.sh if you use apt-get in Debian or Ubuntu!!
